change each_set_exact to each_set_exact_zero where applicable

implement f function in chapter_b

make nu_exceptions visible from the CLI

make a and s (and maybe choose) visible from the CLI

remove excess "as u32"'s

check the 2.. in chapter_c

check special cases of tau^ with Theorem F.88 are implemented correctly

check n = 1 case for all of tau

check ALL taus might need to be (1..=n)? But it throws an exception for some reason

add the N version of the functions where it's possible (such as chapter_f)

change panic to literally anything else (graceful exit)

low priority:
documentation
consistent internal argument orders
graceful exit on completely invalid parameters
